# Learning Algorithm

Two algorithms have been used for comparison:
1) Deep Q-learning (for details go to: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf)
2) Double-Deep Q-learning (for details go to: https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)
Deep Q-Learning tends to overestimate action values. 
Double Q-Learning has been shown to work well in practice to help with this.
